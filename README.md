FoolPy is an experimental small transformer trained on arithmetics

The uber idea is to break computation into many MicroLMs which are build on demand by the system; similar how Lisp is done mostly on itself. For initial step, it makes micro LM which computes next operation for computing arithmetic. The goal is to make combination of two microLMs be 100% reliable.
